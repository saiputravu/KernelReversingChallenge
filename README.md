# KernelReversingChallenge

Try and reverse this kernel without reading the source code :D
This was me learning about building a kernel mainly

# Compile and Run
Make sure you have Qemu installed
```bash
chmod +x ./compile.sh
chmod +x ./run.sh
mkdir build

./run.sh
```

# TODO
Package cleanly with an iso instead of booting the kernel binary
